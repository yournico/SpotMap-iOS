# SpotMap-iOS

Welcome to the SpotMap Repo!

Some Infos real quick.

The App is entirely built on Swift Playground, using only the Swift Programming language & the SwiftUI.
This is basically my first real Project in Swift and i'm too poor for a mac so we I use Swift Playground. 

it's a way for me to learn swift and to make a cool app!

Why open source tho?
I'm hoping to find some people that are better at swift than me, so i can learn from them. I also want to find creative
minds, who have good ideas for new features.
